# Graduate Admissions with PySpark

# Project Description

In ths project we will build a linear regression model using Pyspark ML to predict students' admission at the university. We will use the graduate admission 2  data set from Kaggle. Our goal is to use a Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Algorithm from the Pyspark Machine learning library to predict the chances of getting admission. We will be carrying out the entire project on the Google Colab environment with the installation of Pyspark.
